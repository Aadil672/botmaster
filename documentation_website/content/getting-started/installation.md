To install, simply make sure you have `npm` installed and run the following commands in your project directory:

```bash
npm install --save botmaster
```
If this is a new project, you may need to run `npm init` before for it to work.

If you don't have node and npm installed on your machine yet, I recommend using nvm to manage your node versions. Find out more about it <a id="logo" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.markdown">here</a>
